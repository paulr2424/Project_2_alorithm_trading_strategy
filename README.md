## Algorithm Trading Strategy For The SPY ETF Using Supertrend Indicator + DeepAR Forecasting


### Summary
This project involved developing an algorithmic trading strategy to help automate the decision-making and execution of intraday trading against the SPY ETF (tracks S&P 500).  The solution leverages Alpaca Trading API (for historical data) and the SuperTrend indicator strategy to generate buy/sell signals for intraday trading and to automate order execution.  Furthermore, the Amazon DeepAR Forecasting algorithm was integrated as a real-time trading signal confirmation to use in concert with the automated buy/sell execution of the SuperTrend Trading Bot.

### Use of Supertrend Indicator
The choice for using this indicator was due in part to several reasons. Namely, we wanted an approach that was easy to understand and flexible for many timeframes.  Additionally, we liked that it provides precise buy and sell signals and works well with a trending market.  Since the scope of our project was time-constrained, we opted to implement a "Long-only" trading strategy.

### Model Training

#### SuperTrend Indicator
The Supertrend indicator requires no model training, only the implemetation of the Supertrend Indicator Formula as shown below in figure 1.

According to documentation, the indicator works very well in trending markets.  The buy signal is generated with the "Super Trend" closes below the most recent close price.  Similarly, the sell signal is generated when the "Super Trend" closes above the most recent close price.  Lastly, this trend indicator can be combined with other approaches to generate even "better" signals.  That is what we endeavored to find out here...

#### DeepAR Forecasting
The DeepAR Forecasting algorithm was selected as it is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar time series such as stock market closing prices.  This, theoretically, will allow for the model to extrapolate the time series data into the future for complementary trading signal confirmation.  Moreover,  DeepAR outperforms standard ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques when datasets contain hundreds of related time series.  Figure 2 depicts is a visual overlay of train and test datasets for a given time series (1 day sample at 15 minute timeframe).

### Model Evaluation

The DeepAR Forecasting model uses various hyperparameters to allow for tuning and optimization of the neural network (RNN).  The settings for the parameters that were used for the analysis are shown below:
```
    epochs=40,
    num_cells=32,
    num_layers=3,
    dropout_rate=0.05,
    mini_batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    likelihood="gaussian",
    time_freq=frequency,
    early_stopping_patience=20,
    context_length=16,
    prediction_length=3
```

The DeepAR algorithm evaluates the trained model using the root mean squared error (RMSE) over the test data.  Figure 3 shows the formulat used for time series data:

Additionally, the algorithm evaluates the accuracy of the forecast distribution using weighted quantile loss.  Figure 4 shows the calculations for the weighted quantile loss:

Below is the representative output from training of the model:

### Results
From the live trading sessions, the Supertrend Indicator strategy worked well in identifying Buy/Sell signals at a 15-minute timeframe.  However, because the strategy was "long only", there was one day in our testing session where no trade signals were generated.  Overall, we identified that the DeepAR Model did not appear to effectively forecast future prices or our usage of the forecasted values was not appropriate as implemented.  Of particular note, the downtrend on 12/09 did not trigger and "buy" signals so feedback was limited.  Figure 5 shows the DeepAR Forecast model for end of day which include the closing price targets and corresponding mean predictions with 80% confidence interval for the next 3 successive closing prices.  In this case the predictions seem plausible, albeit the confidence interval is quite large and therefore may has questionable utility.

![Predictions 12/09/2021](/Images/predictions-12-09-2021.png)

On 12/10, there were several uptrend signals generated from the Supertrend Indicator.  However, the DeepAR Forecast was predicting a much lower mean.  Given that, and how we implemented the signal confirmation the end result was that the buy signals were repeatedly overriden for the entire day.
